# Hurricane Ian (2022) Forecasting Error

In this multi-week project we use public hurricane forecast data from the NHC to create forecast visualizations and answer questions like "How close did Ian come to campus?" or "What's the typical distance between where a hurricane is predicted to be 24h in the future and where it actually ends up 24h later?".

In this notebook we tackle two things:

- We visualize and compute the forecasting error, specifically the distance between where the center of the hurricane was predicted to be and where it actually ends up.
- We start discussing regular expressions and how to use them to extract analyzable forecast data from a hurricane's advisories.
